\title{Poison data from Biological Experiment}
\format{This data frame was originally \code{poison.data} from the package
  \code{BHH2}, but as presented here has added columns; no NAs. \describe{
  \item{Poison}{Factor with three levels I, II, and III.}
  \item{Treatment}{Factor with four levels, A, B, C, and D.}
  \item{Group}{Factor with 12 levels, 1:12.}
  \item{SurvTime}{Numeric; survival time.}
  \item{RateSurvTime}{Numeric; inverse of SurvTime}
  \item{RankRateSurvTime}{Numeric; \code{RateSurvTime} scores have
  been converted to ranks, and then rescaled to have the same median as and
  a spread comparable to \code{RateSurvTime}} }}
