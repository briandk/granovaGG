\title{Elemental Graphic Display for Contrast Effect of ANOVA}
\usage{
granovagg.contr(data, contrasts, ylab = "default_y_label",
  plot.theme = "theme_granova_contr", print.four.plots.per.page = TRUE,
  jj = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Vector of scores for all equally sized groups, or a data.fame or
matrix where each column represents a group.}

\item{contrasts}{Matrix of column contrasts with dimensions (number of
groups [G]) x (number of contrasts) [generally (G x G-1)].}

\item{ylab}{Character; y axis label. Defaults to a generic granova title.}

\item{plot.theme}{argument indicating a ggplot2 theme to apply to the
graphic; defaults to a customized theme created for the contrast graphic}

\item{print.four.plots.per.page}{If \code{TRUE}, the function lays out four plots per page and sends
each page to the graphics device. When running R interactively, you'll have an opportunity to review each page
before seeing the next page. Also, when \code{print.four.plots.per.page} is \code{TRUE}, the function won't
return any plot objects as output. When \code{print.four.plots.per.page} is set to \code{FALSE},
the function returns a list of ggplot objects, one element per plot.}

\item{jj}{Numeric; controls \code{\link{jitter}} and allows you to control the
degree of jitter in the contrast plots. \code{jj} is divided by 100 and passed as the \code{amount}
parameter to \code{\link{jitter}}.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments to/from other functions.}
}
\value{
If \code{print.four.plots.per.page} is set to \code{FALSE}, the function returns
  a list of ggplot objects, one element per plot. That allows you to access any individual plot
  or plots, then modify them as you wish (with ggplot2 commands, for example).
  When \code{print.four.plots.per.page} is set to \code{TRUE}
  (the default), the function prints four plots per page on a graphical device
  but returns \code{NULL}.

  The function also provides printed output:
  \item{Weighted Means}{Table showing the (weighted) means for positive
     and negative coefficients for each (row) contrast, and for each row, the
     difference between these means, and the standardized effect size in the
     final column.}
  \item{summary.lm}{Summary results for a linear
     model analysis based on the R function \code{lm} (When effects are simple,
     as in an equal n's power of 2 design, mean differences will generally
     correspond to the linear regression coefficients as seen in the \code{lm}
     summary results.)}
  \item{Contrasts}{The contrast matrix you specified.}
}
\description{
Provides graphic displays that shows data and effects for a priori contrasts
in ANOVA contexts; also corresponding numerical results.
}
\details{
Function provides graphic displays of contrast effects for prespecified
contrasts in ANOVA. Data points are displayed as relevant for each contrast
based on comparing groups according to the positive and negative contrast
coefficients for each contrast on the horizontal axis, against response
values on the vertical axis. Data points corresponding to groups not being
compared in any contrast (coefficients of zero) are ignored. For each
contrast (generally as part of a 2 x 2 panel) a line segment is given that
compares the (weighted) mean of the response variable for the negative
coefficients versus the positive coefficients. Standardized contrasts are
used, wherein the sum of (magnitudes) of negative coefficients is unity; and
the same for positive coefficients. If a line is `notably' different from
horizontal (i.e. slope of zero), a `notable' effect has been identified;
however, the question of statistical significance generally depends on a
sound context-based estimate of standard error for the corresponding effect.
This means that while summary aov numerical results and test statistics are
presented (see below), the appropriateness of the default standard error
generally requires the analyst's judgment. The response values are to be
input in (a stacked) form, i.e. as a vector, for all cells (cf. arg. ylab).
The matrix of contrast vectors \code{contrasts} must have G rows (the number
of groups), and a number of columns equal to the number of prespecified
contrasts, at most G-1. If the number of columns of \code{contrasts} is G-1,
then the number per group, or cell size, is taken to be
\code{length(data)/G}, where \code{G = nrow(contrasts)}.

If the number of columns of \code{contrasts} is less than G-1 then the user
must stipulate \code{npg}, the number in each group or cell.  The function
is designed for the case when all cell sizes are the same, and may be most
helpful when the a priori contrasts are mutually orthogonal (e.g., in power
of 2 designs, or their fractional counterparts; also when specific row or
column comparisons, or their interactions (see the example below based on
rat weight gain data)). It is not essential that contrasts be mutually
orthogonal; but mutual linear independence is required. (When factor levels
correspond to some underlying continuum a standard application might use
\code{con = contr.poly(G)}, for G the number of groups; consider also
\code{contr.helmert(G)}.)  The final plot in each application shows the data
for all groups or cells in the design, where groups are simply numbered from
1:G, for G the number of groups, on the horizontal axis, versus the response
values on the vertical axis.
