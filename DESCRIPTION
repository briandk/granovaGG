Description: This small collection of functions provides
    what we call elemental graphics for display of anova
    results. The term elemental derives from the fact that
    each function is aimed at construction of graphical
    displays that afford direct visualizations of data with
    respect to the fundamental questions that drive the
    particular anova methods. The two main functions are
    granova.1w (a graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w
    (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These
    functions were written to display data for any number
    of groups, regardless of their sizes (however, very
    large data sets or numbers of groups can be
    problematic). For these two functions a specialized
    approach is used to construct data-based contrast
    vectors for which anova data are displayed. The result
    is that the graphics use straight lines, and when
    appropriate flat surfaces, to facilitate clear
    interpretations while being faithful to the standard
    effect tests in anova. The graphic results are
    complementary to standard summary tables for these two
    basic kinds of analysis of variance; numerical summary
    results of analyses are also provided as side effects.
    Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing
    two dependent samples), and granova.contr (which
    provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All
    functions provide relevant numerical results to
    supplement the graphic displays of anova data. The
    graphics based on these functions should be especially
    helpful for learning how the methods have been applied
    to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be
    particularly helpful for students and non-statistician
    analysts. But these methods should be quite generally
    helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as
    they can help to identify outliers, clusters or
    patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear
    transformations of data. In the case of granova.1w and
    granova.ds especially, several arguments are provided
    to facilitate flexibility in the construction of
    graphics that accommodate diverse features of data,
    according to their corresponding display requirements.
