granovaGG 1.1
-------------

MAJOR CHANGES

* granovaGG is compatible with both ggplot2 0.8.9 and ggplot2 0.9.0

* granovaGG now imports most of its dependencies through a NAMESPACE file, 
  so most dependent packages are no longer loaded into the global namespace

MINOR CHANGES

* granovagg.ds provides printed summary output

* granovagg.ds handles axis reversal and visual padding arguments

* granovagg.1w provides better printed summary output, including 
  linear model information

* Users can now suppress printed squares in granovagg.1w

* Printed squares in granovagg.1w now change color if F > F_critical;
  previously they changed color if F > 1. 

granovaGG 1.0

NEW FEATURES

* ggplot2 implementations of three of the four graphical analysis of variance
  functions:
  
    * .1w - elemental graphic for the one-way analysis of variance contr -
    * .elemental graphic for observing contrast effects in one-way analysis of
    * .variance ds - elemental graphic for dependent sample assessment
  
* Since the core functions can return ggplot2 objects (or a list of them, in the
  case of .contr)   you can use the extensibility of ggplot2's grammar of graphics
  to customize your plots
  
* geom_rug_alt - an alternate ggplot2 geom for creating rugs whose tufts appear
  on the top and right   of a graph, instead of the default bottom and left sides
  produced by geom_rug
